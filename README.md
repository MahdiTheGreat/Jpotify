# Jpotify
An application like spotify,without the network component(upcomming)
the gui of the application was designed manually and without a gui editor, and therefore lacks the professional look 
the current implementation should be considered as a extreme prototype,which later could be improved uppon.
the application uses the libararies of mpatric and javazoom.
